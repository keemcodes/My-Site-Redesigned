## My-Site-Redesigned
This is the official redesign of my portfolio site [keem.div](http://keemcodes.com)

## Description
Originally this was suppose to be a small HTML/JS project, then I started playing with React... then I started building an API... and there you have it, full stack portfolio application. Why does anyone need a fullstack portfolio application you might ask? No reason, none at all. This project was just me getting my feet wet with some frameworks I been oggling over the last few years. In this project I used React, Express, NodeJS and Sequelize. This is a good stepping stone to building some other potential full stack applications. 

## History
I more fancy being a backend engineer, but this was an attempt at designing a UI from scratch and coding it. I originally built the concept design in Adobe XD, later implemented the design in HTML/CSS. I was contemplating between native JS or React, I have a ton of experience with native but decided to use this project to take a plunge into React outside of messing with demo snippets in Codepen. With a few Express API snippets I wrote prior, I conjured up my own full stack portfolio application.
